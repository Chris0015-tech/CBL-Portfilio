## Customization

### Colors

The website uses a color scheme defined in CSS variables:

- Primary color: `#1A73E8` (Blue)
- White: `#FFFFFF`
- Light Gray: `#F5F5F5`
- Dark Gray: `#333333`
- Accent colors: `#FFC460` (light gold) and `#6C63FF` (indigo-violet)

To change the color scheme, modify the CSS variables in the `:root` selector in `css/style.css`.

### Content

To update the content of the website, edit the corresponding sections in `index.html`.

### Images

Replace the SVG images in the `images/` directory with your own images. Make sure to maintain the same filenames or update the references in the HTML.

## Contact Form

The contact form is set up for demonstration purposes only. To make it functional, you'll need to implement server-side processing or integrate it with a form submission service.
